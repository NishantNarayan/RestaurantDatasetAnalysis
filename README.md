## 1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?

Definitely yes. The line chart below highlights the difference in the average rating by customers who prefer the restaurant's cuisine and those who don't.

## 2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?

Yes. The customer dashboard below indicates a bias in the customer demographics. To summarize - Single Students from City San Luis Potosi who don't smoke but a casual consumer of alcohol and prefer mexican cuisine comprised a major proportion of the customer distribution

## 3. Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?

Demand-Supply dahsboard image below shows there is an obvious gap in several areas. Cuisine categories such as Mexican, Coffee Shop, Family and Hot Dog seem to have demand in the market whereas not enough restaurants offer them. Similarly, a large gap is evident in offering alcohol - only 33% of the restaurants fall in this category whereas 64% of the customers consume alcohol irrespective of the consumption level

## 4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

As a slightly risk averse investor, most points that I would consider encompasses the demand-supply gap,
1. Cuisine - Enough demand in the market? 
2. Considering majority of the customers are non-smokers and casual drinkers, I would filter down the ones offering alcohol.
3. I also see a convinving reason to go with a medium budget restaurant since about 68% of the customers prefer the same.
After applying the filters discussed, and also keeping in mind the importance of a restaurant's location, I could narrow down to 2 distinguishely placed ones. Utlimately, using weighted rating to choose one over the other, there is a strong reason to go with Gordas De Morales.
